<h1> A DISCUSSION ON WHETHER TECHNOLOGY HAS CAUSE MORE HARM THAN GOOD IN  OUR SOCIETY</h1>

   <h1>Introduction</h2>

     <p>Technology is the use of scientific knowledge for practical purposes, whether in industry or in our everyday lives.
Technology is a major component of today’s society. From cell phones to free Wi-Fi at subway stations, people are constantly connected to or using one form technology. However, constant use of technology has it share of negative effects. To my view technology has cause more harm than good in our society. The following are some of the reasons why technology has cause more harm than good in our society.</p>

   <p><h2>Firstly;</h2> Laziness: technology has caused more laziness in our society these day’s, instead of hard working. We use technology to ease our lives and has eventually reduces our load but has stopped us from thinking and also from exercising the body to release fats. In view of this, technology in one way or the other has taken away our stress but has caused us not to work hard and think smarter towards our ambitions.</p>

    <p><h2>Secondly;</h2> Sickness: most of the sicknesses in our society these day’s are caused by technology. The prolong use of the computer can result you in getting injuries like eye problem, backache, injuries of the arms and hands. Microwave cooking can also be hazardous to your health in number of ways, including creating cancer-causing agents, releasing radioactivity into the environment and causing a degeneration of the immune system. However, technology has helped us to do things quickly, especially cooking with a microwave but has resulted us in many sickness.</p>

     <p><h2>Thirdly;</h2> Education: The internet has become a great tool for learning. You can Google any information you need rather than spend time in the library or attend the course online without leaving home. Yet, tech involvement doesn’t always guarantee the quality of education. Children sometimes overuse technology in classroom which obviously affect learning process in a negative way. Plagiarism and cheating has increased while analysis and critical thinking have declined. This put young generation thinking abilities in jeopardy.<br> The more students use entertainment technologies like games or social media, the less they perform academically.</p>

      <p><h2>In conclusion;</h2> Today’s world is crammed with technology. Almost every family owns a computer, smartphone, television etc. All these make our lives easier. Originally created to serve faithfully to humanity, digital devices have also revealed their harmful impact on our lives. So due the above reasons, technology has cause more harm than good in our society.</p>

       <h1>THE LAWS GOVERNING THE STATE</h1>
<ol>
<li>Intellectual property is the name given to legal rights which protect creative works, inventions and commercial goodwill. Copyright, patents and trademarks, the law of confidence, design rights and, passing off.</li> 

<li>Copyright is a statutory grant that protects creators of intellectual property from having their work copied by others for any purpose during the life of the author plus an additional 70 years after the author’s death. Literary worksnmvvbs (including computer programs, preparatory design material for computer programs and databases); dramatic, musical and artistic works; sound recordings, films, broadcasts.
Patents relate to newly-invented machines or industrial processes. A patent grants the owner an exclusive monopoly on the ideas behind an invention for 20 years</li>

<li>The law of confidence protects information which is not in the public domain. The scope of this branch of intellectual property is considerable and it protects trade secrets, business know-how and information such as lists of clients and contacts, information of a personal nature and even ideas which have not yet been expressed in a tangible form (for example, an idea for a new dramatic play, an idea for a new computer program or a new method of doing business using e-commerce). The law of confidence will protect the contents of many databases.</li>

</li>Trade marks may be registered in respect of goods or services. In the computer industry: for example, the Apple logo, the terms ‘Microsoft’, ‘Windows’ and ‘Adobe Acrobat’ and the Dell monogram. Trademarks are often in the form of a word (sometimes stylised) or a symbol or both and registration is provided for by the Trade Marks Act 1994. Distinctiveness requires that the mark must be capable of distinguishing the goods or services of one undertaking from those of other undertakings. (‘Undertaking’ is the modern word used to describe a trader.) In other words, trademarks must function as ‘badges of origin’: their fundamental purpose is to indicate the origin of the goods or services in respect of which they have been used or applied.</li> 

 <li>Passing Off: An area of law related to trade mark law. This derives from the common law and gives a right of action against anyone who ‘passes off ’ his goods or services as being those of someone else. If a trader uses a particular name or mark or has a particularly unusual method of doing business, he can obtain legal redress against others who use similar names or marks or business methods, especially if there is a serious possibility that the buying public will be deceived and the trader’s business goodwill damaged as a result. The law of passing off is independent of trade mark law and will often be useful where a mark has not been registered as a trade mark.</li>

 <li>Design Right, ‘design’ means the ‘design of any aspect of the shape or configuration (whether external or internal) of the whole or part of an article’. This area of law is complex and this is compounded by the fact that the distinction between the rights is not easy to draw, as there is considerable overlap as regards the rights inter se and with to copyright law.</li>
